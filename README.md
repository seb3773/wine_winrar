winrar x64 wine installation.  
  
This is a winrar x64 installer for linux, with the help of wine :)  
  
No licence provided of course, you must use your own licence of the product.  
The installer was designed for q4os trinity, but should work on any recent debian distro (maybe with some adjustements to the .desktop files).  
  
Instructions:  
  
clone the repository, an cd to the wine_winrar folder  
set install_winrar.sh executable: sudo chmod +x ./install_winrar.sh  
launch the installer: ./install_winrar.sh  
  
Enjoy.
